# 7daychallenge
# Introduction
I'm challenging myself to make a new self-improvement every week for that week. At the end of the week, I will evaluate the usefulness of this week's undertaking and decide whether it is worth continuing. Once again, this is a personal project mostly for my own benefit.
# Week 1
Since I'm beginning this project on a Friday, I will undertake 2 improvements for the remainder of this week and the entirety of next week. 
<ul>
  <li>Run a mile everyday</li>
  <li>Write a story everyday</li>
</ul>

#Run a mile everyday#
This week I intend on running a mile every day. I historically have hated running and would like to improve my cardiovascular endurance. I recently sustained a wrist injury, so I need to keep myself physically fit somehow. It's a basic challenge. I'll allow myself to run at any pace, but I have to run a mile.

#Write a story everyday#
This is something I've wanted to do for a while. I love creative writing. I will write a short story a day for a week. Here are the parameters.
