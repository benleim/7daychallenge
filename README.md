# 7daychallenge
# Introduction
I'm challenging myself to make a new self-improvement every week for that week. At the end of the week, I will evaluate the usefulness of this week's undertaking and decide whether it is worth continuing. Once again, this is a personal project mostly for my own benefit.
# Week 1
This week I intend on running a mile every day. I historically have hated running and would like to improve my cardiovascular endurance. I recently sustained a wrist injury, so I need to keep myself physically fit somehow.
